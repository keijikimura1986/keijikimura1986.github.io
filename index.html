## Description
This week JavaScript, the programming language that enabled the dynamic web, was presented.
JavaScript allows us to connect to the DOM of a website and control every aspect of how the website
looks and behaves. We saw how to build a webpage with various elements and control them with JavaScript.

## Your Task
For your homework you will make your own webpage. This page will be required to take in user data and use the JavaScript
that has been covered to manage this data. At a minimum, your webpage must include the following:
- User interaction elements such as text fields, buttons, counters etc. (any number of these is allowed but there must be some interaction)
- At least one collection of data in the form of an array or object. Collecting user data from a website is cruical.
- A display component that aggregates the user-entered data and displays it on the webpage via manipulation of the DOM
- Submission of this assignment will be done after we have covered Github, which is the topic next week. You will have until next Friday (Sep 20 @ 5pm).


## Recommendations
- Keep your HTML/CSS/JS code in separate files in one folder and use the <script src=''> format to inject the JS into the page when it is loaded.
- Informative ID labels are preferred as sites can become vast, calling a div element "div1" is poor programming. 
- While we covered the necessary components in class, we encourage you to do your own research (W3Schools, MDN, stackoverflow, etc.) to make this website something you would proudly display on your portfolio.
- This website will be the focus of many of our next weeks of classes with GitHub, NodeJS, and Docker ideal places to work on a website/webapp so if you want to use this website as your semester-long piece of work that is developed throughout the semester we very much approve.


NOTE: ALL of the HTML/CSS/JS must be written by you. In future work we will allow the use of libraries and frameworks
      but this week's homework must be fully "vanilla" HTML/CSS/JS code. But make these as appealing as you like. Challenge yourself.
